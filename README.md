A collection of tools and scripts that I use to make my life a little easier
at home and at work

# update-check
Exactly what it says on the tin. Checks for updates and gives a
report (both human and machine readble). Aimed at environments where doing it
properly (ie. Configuration Management) is not possible for either technical
or political reaons.

Currently only supports Red Hat and similar as that is what I use at work. The
only package manager supported is likewise Yum.
